# Index page 
* The main page should consist of all cocktails with a picture of itself and its name
* If I click on one cocktail the image of that cocktail should "flip" and all information about that cocktail should be shown with:
  * Name
  * Picture
  * Ingredients
  * Recipe
  * a "un-flip" button to rotate the cocktail recipe "back"
  
  
## Ingredients
* The fluid information should later be convertet from cl to oz or other "formats"
* Some other information can not be convertet (like 1 piece of orange, ice cubes, etc.)
